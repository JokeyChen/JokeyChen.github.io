  p Hi. My name is Zuqi Chen. I am a software engineer with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at UC San Diego.
  p My favorite things other than programming are aviation, soccer, video games, and Rubik's Cube. I can solve a Rubik's Cube in #[a(href="https://youtu.be/cBU1LnJHIPM") 12 seconds] on average. I am a private pilot and got my license in 2019. You may also check out my #[a(href="/gallery") Gallery] page for my photography work.
