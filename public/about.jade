  p Hi. My name is Zuqi Chen. I am a fourth year student studying Computer Science at UC San Diego. I am currently looking for software development and full stack web development internship for summer 2018.
  p My favorite things other than programming are music, soccer, video games, and Rubik's Cube. I can solve a Rubik's Cube in #[a(href="https://youtu.be/cBU1LnJHIPM") 12 seconds] on average. You may also check out my #[a(href="https://www.instagram.com/jokeychen/") Instagram] for my photography work.
